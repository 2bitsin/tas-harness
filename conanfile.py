"""Conan recipe for tash — written once by `buildutil init`, then
project-owned.

Source of truth for required packages is sources/CMakeLists.txt — the
Require(...) calls are parsed here so both the cmake build and the
conan graph agree on versions. Whether this project itself SHIPS as a
conan package is read from buildutil.toml's [package] section (kind =
library|application, name, version) — the same committed fact the
driver's `buildutil publish` acts on. Without it the recipe is a plain
consumer, exactly as before.
